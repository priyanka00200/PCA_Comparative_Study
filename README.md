In today’s data-driven landscape, making sense of vast datasets is a crucial challenge.
Our project dives into the world of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a powerful
tool that helps make sense of large datasets.This project conducts a thorough exploration
into the impact of PCA on regression models, those mathematical statistics predicting
relationships between variables.PCA are also applied to real-world issues like financial
forecasts and medical diagnoses.This study examines into how PCA influences perfor-
mance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and interpretability of re-
gression models, while also analysing timing and computational efficiency.The approach
involves collecting applicable datasets, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
By comparing baseline regression models with those augmented by PCA, the study aims
to focus on the performance improvement, insights into dimensionality reduction, and a
clearer understanding of computational efficiency.

**Keywords** : PCA, Mean Square Error, dimensionality redution, R-squared.
